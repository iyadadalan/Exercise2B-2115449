            <p>My family and I moved to Scotland because my father was continuing his studies abroad.</p>
            <p>We stayed in Scotland for 4 years before going back to Malaysia. 
                During that time, I went to a local school there and experienced the Scottish Education system that was vastly different as compared to Malaysia's education system.</p>
                <p>Some of the noticable differences that I remember were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No exams in primary school education</li>
                <li>School started at 8AM for both primary and secondary schools</li>
                <li>Homework was not given out regularly</li>

        <h3><i>Summary of Glasgow</i></h3>
        <p>From my personal experience, the people of Glasgow and Scotland in general are all very welcoming people.
            Through out the 4 years that I have lived there, I managed to gain many fond memories of the place and sometimes
            reminisce about the good old days.
        </p>
        <p>If you do ever find yourself in the UK at any point in your life, please consider visiting Scotland as it will not disappoint
            in giving you an enjoyful trip that will be remembered for the rest of your life.

        <h3><i>Summary of Paris</i></h3>
        <p>From what I can remember, Paris was a very beautiful city filled with countless historical landmarks that are worth seeing as tourists. 
            However, my family had a really hard time trying to find Halal food at the time so we had to settle for packed/instant food.
        </p>
        <p>I would recommend visiting Paris to someone who has never set foot in the continent of Europe before as it will give a strong first
            impression of what to expect from other countries in that part of the world. Just remember to pack some food while travelling and beware of pick-pocketers!
